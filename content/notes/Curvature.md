Basically if I try to fit a circle in a curve (which is also called osculaing circle), I can find the curvature of that curve. So if my fitted circle is small, it means the curvature is more, and if fitted circle is large, curvature is less. 

In geometry processing, we discuss three types of curvatures. 
- Principal Curvature
- Mean Curvature
- Gaussian Curvature
