title: "Quaternions"

These are described similar to complex numbers. They can be imagined as existing in 4D space. They are composed of 1D real number line (real part) and 3 imaginary complex number lines (vector part). They can be represented as:
$a + bi + cj + dk$
where $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i,j,k$ are imaginary/ quaternion units. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) gives a good way to visualise this 4D space.

#### Multiplication rules:
- $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1$
- $ij = -ji = k$
- $jk = -kj = i$
- $ki = -ik = j$
