title: "Cummulative Distributive Function"
alias: CDF
---
CDF (cummulative distribution function) of any probability density function can be found by using integrating it. It can be thought of area under the curve of PDF.
The formula for the CDF is given:
$$D(x) = \frac{1}{2}[1 + sgn(x - \mu)(1 - e^{\frac{-|x - \mu|}{b}}$$
Here $sgn$ is a sign function.
